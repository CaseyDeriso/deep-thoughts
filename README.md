Once a user signs up for the application, they can post their own thoughts and reactions as well as add others to their friends list. logged in users stay authorized with a JSON Web Token that is stored on the client side. Thoughts, reactions and user data is stored in a MongoDB server, CRUD operations are performed through a graphQL API and the front end is powered by react, apollo react hooks, and React Router DOM.
